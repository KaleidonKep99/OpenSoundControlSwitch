# VRChatOSCSwitch
Ever wanted to run multiple OSC apps at once while playing VRChat?<br />
If so, you might know that VRChat will not communicate with multiple apps on the same UDP ports (9000 and 9001).

This is why I created this app, which will act as a "switch" between the OSC apps (VRCFT, YeelightOSC etc.) and the target app (VRChat).

This is how the program works:<br/>
